    "#### 10% marks\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used distance metrics is the Euclidean distance. The Euclidean distance between two points in the Euclidean space (also known as $L_2$ norm) is defined as the length of the line segment between those two points. For example, if we have two points in 2D space (i.e. two samples consisting of two features), $\\mathbf{x}_0 = \\{x_{0,0}, x_{0,1}\\}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_1 = \\{x_{1,0}, x_{1,1}\\}$, we can calculate the distance as:\n",

    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to calculate the difference between the first features of the two samples, the difference between the second features of the two samples, then square each of the differences, sum those squares, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when we are dealing with points in nD space (corresponding to samples with n features) of the form $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{0,i}, x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, the procedure is very similar. To calculade the Euclidean disatnce, you need to calculate the difference between the corresponding features of two samples, square each of the differences, and calculate the square root of the resulting sum:\n",

    "\n",
    "In each decision node of a decision tree, this classifier splits the dataset into two or more parts according to a value of a certain feature in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of M samples $\\mathbf{x} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i\\} \\forall i=1..M$ with n features each $\\mathbf{x}_i = \\{x_{1,i}, \\dots, x_{n,i}\\}$, we could decide to split the dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ (numerical) feature at value $v$. This would mean splitting the dataset into:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{<}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} < v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ smaller than $v$ and\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} \\geq v\\}$, which contains all the samples with the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ greater or equal than $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we could decide to split a dataset at the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature which is categorical. If the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ feature of a sample $\\mathbf{x}_i$ can hold values $\\{\\texttt{child}, \\texttt{teen}, \\texttt{adult}\\}$, the resulting subsets would be:\n",
    "- the subset $\\mathbf{x_{\\texttt{child}}} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_i | x_{j,i} = \\texttt{child}\\}$, which contains all the samples with the feature $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ equal to $\\texttt{child}$, \n",

    "\n",
    "In each node of the decision tree, the dataset is split according to the attribute $j$ which results in **the highest information gain** after the split. For categorical features, there is only one possible split (each category becomes a subset). For numerical features, it is neccessary to check all the possible values of split. For example, if the $j^{\\texttt{th}}$ in the dataset has appeared with the values of $\\{1, 1.5, 2.7, 3.2, 5\\}$, you need to calculate the information gain for splitting the dataset at $v=1.5$ (into $\\mathbf{x_{< 1.5}}$ and $\\mathbf{x_{\\geq 1.5}}$), $v=2.7$, $v=3.2$, $v=5$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using kNN for the batteries dataset returned an accuracy of 0.5833, a Cohen's Kappa of 0.3651 and the precision and recall for monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic was 0.56 and 0.62, 0.67 and 0.60 and 0.5 and 0.5 respectively.\n",
    "For the decision tree, the accuracy was 0.5417 and Cohen's Kappa was 0.2997. For monoclinic, orthorhombic and triclinic the precision and recall were 0.43 and 0.62, 0.62 and 0.5 and 0.67 and 0.5 respectively. Therefore, overall we could say that kNN was more accurate than a decision tree, with accuracy being True Positives and True Negatives / Total. Precision is True Positives / Number of Predicted Yeses. On average this was 0.577 (3sf) for kNN and 0.573 (3sf) for a decision tree, meaning kNN is more precise. Recall is True Positives / Actual Number of Yeses which for kNN was an average of 0.573 (3sf) compared to 0.54 for a decision tree, meaning kNN was better at recall. Finally, Cohen's Kappa is defined as \"the level of agreement between two raters or judges who each classify items into mutually exclusive categories.\" (Zach, 2021). Again kNN produces a higher score, this time for Cohen's Kappa, showing that there is a better level of agreement between the model and the true values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional metrics that could have been used are specificity, which evaluates the number of True Negatives / Actual Number of Nos, the false positive rate which is the False Positives / Actual Number of Nos (however this is just 1 - specificity) or the misclassification rate, which is the number of False Positives and False Negatives / Total \n",
    "(however this is 1 - accuracy). Overall, the better model was kNN as it outperformed decision trees for each metric. This could be because the batteries dataset had a max_depth of -1, which would mean that there was no stopping condition for depth. This could have led to the tree overfitting the data as the tree would be very deep and so would only be memorising the training data as opposed to working on unseen examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of all the metrics that I would choose to report, I would choose recall. This is because recall can be used to plot an ROC curve, which is a way to determine how good the models are at classifying data. By obtaining both recall and the false positive rate, we could plot an ROC curve by having recall on y and false positive rate on x. It would also be possible to change the values of k in kNN together with the depth in the decision tree to obtain different recall values (and false positive rate values) and then plot these on the ROC curve. We could then work out the area under the graph. The closer the area under the graph is to 1, the better the model is at predicting data (Shaneyfelt, 2019). This could mean that, on average, the decision tree could be a better classifier overall if it's area under the curve that was closer to 1 and thus is better at predicting data.  \n",

    "KNN is a non-parametric model. This means that no assumptions are made about the data and that the number of parameters is equal to the number of data points. As a result it does not scale well. As the number of data samples increases so the model will need to look at every single data point in order to obtain the k best samples. As the sample size increases, the model will take a larger amount of time to analyize all data points. Equally, decision trees are also non-parametric and, due to being created recursively they will have a \"memory complexity of O(N)\" (StackOverflow, 2017). However, kNN does have a \"space complexity of O(Nd)\" (Kumar, 2021) where \"d is dimensionality\" (Kumar, 2021) which simplifies to O(N). Since there is a scalar involved with kNN, kNN will likely use more memory for very large datasets than the recursive decision tree. \n",
    "    \n",
    "The model that trains fastest is kNN. This is because it has a \"time complexity of O(kNd)\" (Kumar, 2021) where k is number of neighbours and d is \"dimensionality of the data\" (Kumar, 2021). Decision trees have a \"time complexity of O(dNlogN)\" (Kumar, 2021) where d is \"the dimensionality of the data\" (Kumar, 2021). Simplified this means that kNN is O(N) and decision trees are O(NlogN) which in turn means that kNN has the smaller time complexity and therefore trains faster. During runtime, the time complexity for decision trees will be \"O(d) where d is the depth of the tree\" (Kumar, 2021). This would essentially end up being O(N) complexity. Equally time complexity at runtime for kNN is \"O(nd+kn) runtime or O(ndk) runtime\" (StackExchange, 2016) which would again simplify to O(N). The model that reaches a decision faster will be determined by whether the number of samples for kNN is less than the depth of the tree in the decision tree. If kNN has fewer samples (and the values of k and d are low) a decision will be reached quicker to predict a class. If not, the decision tree will predict the class quicker. However, as it's unlikely that the depth of the tree would be greater than the number of samples in kNN, it's more likely that the decision tree will be quicker.\n",

    "The role of normalisation in numerical data is \"the process of casting the data to the specific range, like between 0 and 1\" (Ali et all, 2014, p1) and is specifically done \"when there are big differences in the ranges of different features\" (Ali et all, 2014, p1). The way to normalize data for machine learning is \"xnorm = (xi – xmin) / (xmax – xmin)\" (Zach, 2021) and is used when there are no outliers in the data (Ali et all, 2014, p1). There is another method known as Z-Score Standardization which assumes a normal distribution of data and is worked out by \"(x[i]-mean of x)/standard deviation of x\" (Ali et all, 2014, p5). Data should be normalized as \"normalization ensures that no one variable may influence the performance of the model in a particular way simply due to the fact that it has larger numbers.\" (Croydon Early Learning, 2022). If, therefore, there were certain values in the dataset that were higher than other values, it could decrease the model's accuracy, so by normalizing the data any discrepancies are removed while making sure the relationship of the data is still the same. This may create better models and therefore more accurate results.\n",

    "There are various shortcomings in using a training test split for training an algorithm. One main disadvantage is that while a simple train-test split is cheap, it is unreliable for future performance, especially when the dataset used is very small. \"There will also not be enough data in the test set to effectively evaluate the model performance. The estimated performance could be overly optimistic (good) or overly pessimistic (bad).\" (Brownlee, 2020), meaning that our model may be more unpredictable when testing the data and, as a result, may not be fully accurate. \n",
    "    \n",
    "A better way to test the data would be to use Cross Validation (CV). There are two types that can be used, Leave One Out Cross Validation or k-fold Cross Validation. K-fold separates the data into k number of train-test splits. This means that for each iteration different values in the dataset will be used for each test set. Therefore we obtain a higher proportion of testing data overall, as more samples are used in testing, meaning a more reliable future performance. LOOCV takes one sample from the dataset for testing, trains the rest of the data and then repeats this for all the samples in the dataset. As every sample is being tested once in LOOCV it means we obtain the highest amount of testing data possible, which thus makes it the most reliable for future performance. A drawback in using CV for k-fold, is that it can get computationally expensive if k is large. In using LOOCV, every sample is being used for CV and so large datasets will also be computationally expensive. \n",

    "We could also, if we were to use a simple train-test split, introduce a validation set of say 10% of the data. This could be used to help prevent overfitting our model and is done during training to see how well the model is perfoming on unseen data. As the data is trained, both the training and validation error will decrease. However, if the validation error starts to increase, then the model starts to be overfitted and the programmer can choose to stop training the model. This is called early stopping.\n",
